# Terraform Structure Example

This repository provides an example infrastructure setup for Terraform, organized into different environments (development, staging, production) with two main modules: `global-variables` and `naming`.

## Repository Structure

-   `development/marketing`: Configuration for the development environment.
-   `staging/marketing`: Configuration for the staging environment.
-   `production/marketing`: Configuration for the production environment.
-   `modules`: Contains reusable Terraform modules.

## Modules

### global-variables

### naming
